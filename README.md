# Dev Portfolio

🚀 **[Dev Portfolio V2 has arrived. Meet Devfolio, a modern portfolio + blog template built with GatsbyJS and TailwindCSS](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devfolio)** 🚀

This repo contains a personal dev portfolio template that was created with Sass and JavaScript. It is lightweight and fully responsive, as well as comes with the Bootstrap grid system and loaded with Font Awesome. The site is static and comes production ready if you just want to add your information and go. Alternatively, you can edit styles, colours, and scripts fairly easily.
